This is app was designed with the purpose of visualizing a security's performance realitve to that of it's broader industry. You can also put the security of your choosing up against ETF's that track the performance of the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and NASDAQ to see how the security you selected is performing relative to the market as whole.
How to use the app:
To start, create an account or login if you have an existing account. Once you are logged in, you will be prompted to select a stock from the dropdown menu. The charting defaults to daily time intervals for the closing price of each trading day, but can be changed to weekly or monthly time intervals as well. 
Clicking on the '+' button to right of your selected stock chart will add this stock to your profile, along with more detailed trading data such as the last trading day's high, low, and closing prices. You may only add stocks to your profile if the time interval is set to daily. 
The API used to retrieve stock and ETF data has a 5 call per-minute limit. When you have a exhausted this limit, you will be notified and must refresh the page after 30 seconds.
